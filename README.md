# fetch
A copy of neofetch but made in Rust and functions only on Linux (afaik).

# Requirements
Linux (any distro) <br>
Cargo <br>

# Setup
```
$ cargo test
$ cargo build
$ cd target/debug
$ mv fetch /usr/bin 
``` 
Now you can add fetch to the bottom of your .bashrc or .whatevershellrc <br> or just execute `fetch` in the terminal.

# Contribute
It's a personal project, you *can't* contribute.
